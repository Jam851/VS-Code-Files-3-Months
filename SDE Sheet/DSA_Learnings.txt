Palindrome - strings that are the same when read backwards

LEARNINGS ->
• O(log10(N)) - Time Complexity for when input is divided by 10 for N times
• The most time to solve a problem is taken up by 'actual' coding instead of making 
  the plan to solve it.
• O(n) > O(log n)			[ by an exponential margin ]
• Array in js can be sorted using a method 
   let arr = [1, 4, 0, 5, 10, 9]
   arr.sort((a, b) => a - b)

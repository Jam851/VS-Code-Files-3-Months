         <strong>My Architectural Education</strong> 
        <em>~Surabhi Naik</em>

        made me insecure 

        about words. 

        It was always - Drawings before Words. 

        Inside, what are lines without life, I thought. But 

        the obedient rebel that I was, I complied. 

        So I made 'drawings'. I drew in straight lines 

        and measured curves, and careful thinnesses 

        of pencil strokes.

        My Architectural Education had no time to waste 

        on my misshapen wilderness. It taught me that using 

        words to build my worlds was Unacceptable. 

        Untoward. 

        It was always - drafting the drawings. 

        Never, drawing the drawings. 

        So I was careful not to stray too far from the instrument. 

        Knowing I was at least one instrument too heavy.

        My Architectural Education taught me about Beauty, 

        the kind that was immortalized in 'text'books made of 

        lustrous paper, erudite sentences and privileged men.

        It was always - SomethingNewSomethingUnique but 

        within reason. 

        So I stepped in from the sidewalk 

        and marched in the army. 

        A Left. then Right. then Left.

        One of the first things I remember conjuring 

        out of thin air was a poem about trees. 

        One of the first things I remember drawing 

        was a portrait of a famous man with a french beard 

        in a blue studio with blue lights calling the screen 

        'computerji'. 

        And he was just as blue if not bluer in the 

        scrawny scratches of my mom's blue ball-point pen. 

        

        And so, the words had to spill, right? Somewhere. 

        Like the streams that erode their way into the ocean.

        <strong>Theme With Variations</strong>
        <em>~Lawrence Fray</em>
        
        How you look doesn’t matter at all.
        
        Whether your saree’s draped just right
        
        Or a light, chiffon shawl will pair
        
        Correctly with your braided hair;
        
        How the silk should pleat, or fall----
        
        All that’s neither here nor there.
        
        Do not fret, do not fear:
        
        I am always waiting, dear.
        
        It’s not as if you’d really notice me
        
        But nothing you can do affects the matter;	
        
        If I should choose sweet, honeyed words that flatter
        
        And begin again, perhaps then you’ll see
        
        That how you look doesn’t really matter at all.
        
        If you’re designer saree’s draped just right
        
        Or a feather-light chiffon shawl is bright
        
        Enough to offset your cascaded, braided hair;
        
        How the lustrous silk should pleat, or fall---
        
        When all’s told, that’s neither here nor there.
        
        Why should you ever fear, why should you fret?
        
        You’ll always be mine, my dear; I’ll never forget.
        
        As years go by, you’ll think of me more often
        
        And should you ever wish, I’ll sing your praises,
        
        Extol your virtues and your beauty in phrases 
        
        Of wonder. Perhaps, in time, your heart may soften---
        
        And realise that how you look doesn’t matter at all.
        
        It’s nothing personal; in time, I come to everyone.
        
        Please understand, the rich, the grand, or those now cast upon
        
        The shoaling strand of poverty and pain----it’s all the same.
        
        To tell the truth, I’ve lived too long and hate to call 
        
        On those who don’t deserve the peace I bring, who blame
        
        Their brigandage and selfish, evil deeds on me.
        
        I merely wait and count their days, silently.
        
        We flit like ha’penny sparrows through Bede’s mead-hall: firelit, warmed,
        
        While all about, Winter’s storms fiercely surge and rage.
        
        Your entry in life’s ledger’s but a paltry line on a page
        
        And then it’s over and you’re for the dark, perhaps to be transformed---
        
        I’ve not been informed. Your voyage is one of self-discovery. 
        
        But this I know for sure: even a sparrow doesn’t fall unseen,
        
        And every hair on your head is numbered. Best not to fear the night;
        
        You could be happier than if you stayed. The trip with me, of course, is free, 
        
         
        
        And how you look won’t matter after all.
        
        Whether you’re georgette saree’s draped just right
        
        Or a gauzy, chiffon shawl diffracts the light
        
        When you parade your braided, faded hair,
        
        Or how your sensual silk should fold, or fall----
        
        Leave this charade, come as you are---or dare.
        
        And do not fret at all, neither sigh.
        
        Take my hand; I’m waiting here, nearby.
